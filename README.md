#Git Team Workflow

>It is important to follow a Git team workflow for several reasons:

>_- Keep an historic of the source code_

>_- Avoid "side effects"_

>_- Easier to roll back when one or more bugs impact the project_

>_- Automatic builds and deploys when merging PR from within Github_

The following resources explain concepts to understand and steps to follow to work in that "spirit"

###1 - [The official documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
